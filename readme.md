## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps for both the backend and frontend:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIsTushar/hands-on-volunteering-platform
cd hands-on-volunteering-platform

```

### 2. Set up the Backend

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install the backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://postgres:root@localhost:5432/hands_on_db
PORT = 5000
JWT_SECRET = mysecretkey
NODE_ENV = development
CLIENT_URL = http://localhost:5173

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = <your-cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = <your-api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = <your-api-secret>

```

Run the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Set up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and a database named hands_on_db created.

### Authentication Middleware

The application uses **cookie-parser** middleware for authentication. After logging in, a session cookie is set to authenticate further requests. For all protected routes, the cookie is checked to ensure the user is authenticated.

To access protected routes, users must have a valid session cookie. The backend will validate the cookie and allow or deny access based on the session's validity.

---

### Notes on Authentication

- **Login**: A user can authenticate via the `/api/auth/login` endpoint. Upon successful login, a session cookie is created and sent to the client.
- **Logout**: Use `/api/auth/logout` to destroy the session and remove the authentication cookies.
